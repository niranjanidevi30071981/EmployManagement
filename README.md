## ASP.NET Web Forms Refactor Challenge

#### Overview
Your task is to refactor an existing ASP.NET Web Forms application to enhance its functionality according to your own ideas,
responsiveness, and architecture. The goal is to demonstrate proficiency in Web Forms concepts, client-side scripting with jQuery and AJAX, 
and the implementation of an API endpoint, all while maintaining a clean codebase that adheres to the separation of concerns principle.

#### Objectives

1. **Web Forms Controls and Postback Handling**
   - **State Management:** Demonstrate effective use of Web Forms state management techniques to maintain data across postbacks.
   - **Event Handling:** Implement event handlers for server controls to respond to user actions like button clicks and dropdown selections.

2. **Client-Side Scripting**
   - **jQuery and AJAX:** Enhance the application's responsiveness and interactivity by utilizing jQuery for DOM manipulation and AJAX for asynchronous server calls. Implement functionality such as form validation, partial page updates, and dynamic content loading without full page refreshes.

3. **API Endpoint Integration**
   - **Single API Endpoint:** Create a single API endpoint within the Web Forms application. This endpoint should handle a specific action (e.g., submitting form data) and return data in JSON format. Demonstrate how to call this endpoint using AJAX and process the response.

4. **Code Organization and Separation of Concerns**
   - **Layered Architecture:** Structure your application code across separate layers (e.g., presentation, business logic, data access) to demonstrate the separation of concerns. Ensure each layer is responsible for specific types of tasks and communicates with other layers appropriately.
   - **Reusable Components:** Create user controls (.ascx) for reusable UI components, showcasing encapsulation and modularity.

#### Key Concepts

Your solution must effectively demonstrate the following ASP.NET Web Forms concepts:

- **Controls and Postbacks:** Proficient use of Web Forms controls and understanding postback mechanism.
- **Client-Side Scripting:** Leveraging jQuery and AJAX for a more dynamic and responsive user interface.
- **Web API:** Integrating an API endpoint within a Web Forms application for asynchronous data handling.
- **Architecture:** Applying separation of concerns through a layered architecture approach.
- **State Management:** Managing state across postbacks efficiently.
- **Event Handling:** Implementing server control events to handle user interactions.

#### Instructions

- **Setup:** Begin by cloning the provided starter Web Forms project repository.
- **Development:** Implement the enhancements as outlined in the objectives, focusing on improving functionality, user experience, and code quality.
- **Documentation:** Comment your code to highlight architectural decisions, separation of concerns, and the implementation of key functionalities.
- **Submission:** Complete the project according to the provided submission guidelines.

#### Evaluation Criteria

Your project will be assessed based on:

- Implementation of the functionalities as specified in the objectives.
- Adherence to ASP.NET Web Forms best practices and coding standards.
- Code quality, including structure, readability, and documentation.
- Effective use of jQuery, AJAX, and API integration for responsive design.
- Application of separation of concerns and clean architecture principles.

This challenge will test your ability to work with ASP.NET Web Forms, enhance application responsiveness with client-side scripting, and maintain clean, well-structured code. Good luck, and we look forward to reviewing your project!
